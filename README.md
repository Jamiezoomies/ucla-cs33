## Data Lab
The Data Lab involves manipulating bitwise operations to work correctly and efficiently.

## Bomb Lab
The Bomb Lab is a exercise where I had to defuse phases by examining and understanding the assembly code. It helps you understand low-level programming and debugging.

## Attack Lab
The Attack Lab focuses on security and exploits, teaching how buffer overflow attacks and other common exploits work. 

## Parallel Lab
The Parallel Lab involves working with OpenMP and parallel programming concepts and techniques to optimize programs for multi-core processors.
